 Enter Chorus.

CHORUS.
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

 [_Exit._]

ACT I

SCENE I. A public place.

 Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.

SAMPSON.
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

GREGORY.
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON.
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.

GREGORY.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.

SAMPSON.
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.

SAMPSON.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.

GREGORY.
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.'), 

(2, 'Wines and liquor', 'A rundown of the alcoholic beverages you will be serving.', "The preparation of the wines in cask and the bottling take place in the
lower of the two celliers, a mere lad being enabled, by the aid of the
mechanism provided, to bottle from six to eight thousand bottles a day.
A single workman can cork about 4,500 bottles, which a second workman
secures with metal agrafes before they are lowered into the cellars. The
latter are of two stories, each being divided into three long parallel
galleries 20 feet high and 23 feet wide, vaulted with stone and floored
with cement. Bordering the endless stacks of bottles are small gutters,
into which the wine flows from the exploded bottles. Lofty, well
ventilated, and beautifully cool, the temperature invariably ranging
from 45° to 47° Fahrenheit, these capitally-constructed cellars combine
all that is required for a champagne establishment of the first class.
The breakage has never exceeded 3 per cent., whereas in some old cellars
which the firm formerly occupied in the centre of the city, their
breakage on one occasion amounted to ten times this quantity.

At Fisse, Thirion, and Co.'s, after the wine has been disgorged and
liqueured, the corks are secured neither with string nor wire, but a
special metal fastener is employed for the purpose. This consists of a
triple-branched agrafe, provided with a kind of hinge. A tiny toy
needle-gun suspended to the agrafe is pulled outwards and turned over
the top of the bottle, whereupon the fastening becomes instantly
disengaged, and anything like trouble, uncleanliness, or annoyance is
entirely avoided. The operation is so easy that a mere child can open a
bottle of champagne, secured by this patent fastener, as easily and
rapidly as a grown-up man.

The firm of Fisse, Thirion, and Co. succeeded that of Fisse, Fraiquin,
and Co.--established originally at Reims in 1821--in 1864, when the
brand of the house was already well known on the Continent, more
especially in Belgium and Holland. Since that time the wines have been
largely introduced into England and the United States, and the firm, who
have secured medals at many of the recent exhibitions, to-day have
agents in the English and Dutch Indies and the various European
settlements in China. Several descriptions of wine are shipped by the
house, the finest being their dry Cuvée Reservèe and their fragrant
soft-tasting Cachet d'Or."),

(3, 'Etiquette', 'How to treat guests.', "Your first step should be, of course, the securing of an introduction.
Introductions still play an important part in social intercourse, and
many errors are often perpetrated by those ignorant of savoir faire
(correct form). When introducing a young lady to a stranger for example,
it is not au fait (correct form) to simply say, Mr. Roe, I want you to
shake hands with my friend Dorothy. Under the rules of the beau monde
(correct form) this would probably be done as follows: Dorothy (or Miss
Doe), shake hands with Mr. Roe. Always give the name of the lady first,
unless you are introducing some one to the President of the United
States, the Archbishop of Canterbury, a member of the nobility above a
baron, or a customer. The person who is being introduced then extends
his (or her) right ungloved hand and says, Shake. You shake, saying
at the same time, It's warm (cool) for November (May), to which the
other replies, I'll say it is.

This brings up the interesting question of introducing two people to
each other, neither of whose names you can remember. This is generally
done by saying very quickly to one of the parties, Of course you know
Miss Unkunkunk. Say the last unk very quickly, so that it sounds like
any name from Ab to Zinc. You might even sneeze violently. Of course, in
nine cases out of ten, one of the two people will at once say, I didn't
get the name, at which you laugh, Ha! Ha! Ha! in a carefree manner
several times, saying at the same time, Well, well--so you didn't
get the name--you didn't get the name--well, well. If the man still
persists in wishing to know who it is to whom he is being introduced,
the best procedure consists in simply braining him on the spot with a
club or convenient slab of paving stone.

The introduction, in cases where you have no mutual friend to do the
introducing, is somewhat more difficult but can generally be arranged as
follows:

Procure a few feet of stout manila rope or clothes-line, from any of
the better-class hardware stores. Ascertain (from the Social Register,
preferably) the location of the young lady's residence, and go there
on some dark evening about nine o'clock. Fasten the rope across the
sidewalk in front of the residence about six inches or a foot from the
ground. Then, with the aid of a match and some kerosene, set fire to
the young lady's house in several places and retire behind a convenient
tree. After some time, if she is at home, she will probably be forced to
run out of her house to avoid being burned to death. In her excitement
she will fail to notice the rope which you have stretched across
the sidewalk and will fall. This is your opportunity to obtain an
introduction. Stepping up to her and touching your hat politely, you
say, in a well modulated voice, I beg your pardon, Miss Doe, but I
cannot help noticing that you are lying prone on the sidewalk. If she
is well bred, she will not at first speak to you, as you are a perfect
stranger. This silence, however, should be your cue to once more tip
your hat and remark, I realize, Miss Doe, that I have not had the honor
of an introduction, but you will admit that you are lying prone on the
sidewalk. Here is my card--and here is one for Mrs. Doe, your mother.
At that you should hand her two plain engraved calling cards, each
containing your name and address. If there are any other ladies in her
family--aunts, grandmothers, et cetera--it is correct to leave cards for
them also. Be sure that the cards are clean, as the name on the calling
card is generally sufficient for identification purposes without the
addition of the thumbprint.

When she has accepted your cards, she will give you one of hers, after
which it will be perfectly correct for you to assist her to rise from
the sidewalk. Do not, however, press your attentions further upon her at
this time, but after expressing the proper regret over her misfortune it
would be well to bow and retire"),
